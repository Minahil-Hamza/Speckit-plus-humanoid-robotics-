To start the frontend, please follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    `cd physical-ai-robotics`
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `npm install`
3.  **Start the development server:**
    `npm start`

Once the frontend server is running, it will usually provide a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) in your terminal where you can view the application.

Please let me know once you have started both the backend and frontend, and confirm the URLs they are running on.
